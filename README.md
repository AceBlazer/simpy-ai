LINUX
enable cron (30 sec counter)

\*Brief descroption
1st idea was to make a shopify app that indexes product images of the store and provide customers to search for similar products within 0-0.9 seconds (icon on search bar or/and top-left of product image anywhere on the store).
then add real work: provide merchants with marketing goals like graphics and analytics and emails about most searched images, origin country of search, etc.
then provide a mobile app that searches for similar images within stores that have simply app installed on.

why? there's google? Well, google doesnt give only commerce results, also it's not mobile app (super easy on mobiles cuz take picture and search instantly), searches only in stores that have the app (data privacy and assurance transparency) + provide analytics to merchants to achieve marketing goals.
